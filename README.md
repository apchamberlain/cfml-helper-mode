# cfml-helper-mode
Major mode for editing CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language) files.

# Credits
According to the comments this code was originally written by Nelson Minar, and was updated by Gian Uberto Lauri in 1999 to work with Emacs 19.  

# This is a WIP
This code appears to have been abandoned.  It does not work on Emacs 24, probably nothing later than 22.  My goal is to bring it up to date with a minimum of effort, although in the long run it may be smarter to start over with one of the HTML editing modes.
